# Hey there! 👋 I'm Ulises

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an AI Engineering Leader and Senior Data Scientist passionate about building AI solutions that make a real difference. With over 10 years in finance and tech, I love tackling complex problems with machine learning and AI.

## What I Do 🚀

Currently leading AI engineering at **Salesforce**, where I get to work on some pretty cool stuff - from tax automation to recruitment tools. Before this, I spent time at **Google Cloud** building everything from PointNet-based auto-quoting systems to chatbots that actually help people.

I have a bit of an unusual background - I've spent a lot of time in the finance world, particularly in anti-money laundering and risk management. This combo of finance + tech has been super valuable for building AI systems that are not just technically sound, but also compliant and ethical. Plus, I once helped identify and shut down a network of 100 accounts involved in human trafficking, which was both challenging and incredibly meaningful work.

## What I'm Into 🛠️

**Programming:** Python • R • SQL • JavaScript  
**ML/AI:** PyTorch • TensorFlow • Deep Learning • Gen AI • Document AI • Gemini  
**Cloud:** GCP • Vertex AI • BigQuery • Dialogflow • Document AI • Cloud Run  
**Data:** Statistical Analysis • Time Series • Customer Segmentation • BigData Processing  
**Other:** API Development • Microservices • Docker • Infrastructure as Code

I'm pretty much a Google Cloud fanatic (have 4 GCP certifications to prove it 😅) and love working with the latest in generative AI. Whether it's building custom models with PyTorch or leveraging managed services like Vertex AI, I enjoy finding the right tool for the job.

## Cool Stuff I've Built 💼

### 🤖 **AI Lead @ Salesforce** (Jun 2025 - Present)
Leading a centralized AI team working on internal tools that actually matter - tax systems, finance automation, and recruitment tools. It's pretty rewarding when your AI makes people's jobs easier!

### ⚡ **AI Engineer @ Google Cloud** (Nov 2022 - Jun 2025)
Built some fun stuff here:
- **PointNet Auto-Quoting System**: Helped manufacturers get instant quotes for custom parts
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Used Document AI and LLMs to automate boring paperwork
- **Smart Chatbot**: Created a Dialogflow bot that actually understood what customers were asking

### 🔍 **Financial Crime Detective @ Citibanamex** (Jul 2020 - Nov 2022)
This was intense - led a team of 6 data scientists building ML models to catch financial criminals. Our biggest win? Identifying and shutting down 100 accounts involved in human trafficking. Sometimes code really can help save lives.

### 📊 **Risk Modeling @ HSBC** (Jan 2019 - Jul 2020)
Built models to assess financial crime risk across the entire customer base. Lots of regulatory compliance work, but satisfying when everything clicks together.

### 💰 **Alert Optimization @ Citibanamex** (Sep 2016 - Jan 2019)
Reduced false positive alerts by 40% - saved the bank money and made analysts much happier!

## My Background 🎓

### Google Cloud Certified (4x!) ☁️
- Professional Data Engineer
- Professional ML Engineer  
- Professional Cloud Architect
- Associate Cloud Engineer

Yeah, I might be a little obsessed with GCP 😄

### Education 📚
- **M.S. Data Science** - Universidad Panamericana
- **B.S. Mathematics** - UNAM  
- **B.S. Computer Engineering** - ITAM
- **B.S. Business Management** - ITAM

I have a weird thing for collecting degrees - math gives me the theory, engineering the technical chops, and business helps me understand why we're building stuff in the first place.

## Stuff I've Written 📝

- **["Convert2PDF: An API to Transform Microsoft Office Files into PDF"](https://medium.com/google-cloud/convert2pdf-an-api-to-transform-microsoft-office-files-into-pdf-3c95ada29d67)** (2024) - Featured on Google Cloud Community Medium, showcasing practical cloud deployment
- **"Detección de fraude interno utilizando metodologías de aprendizaje máquina"** (2020) - My deep dive into using ML for fraud detection

## Current Interests & Focus Areas 🔬

**Generative AI & LLMs:** Exploring the intersection of Document AI with modern language models like Gemini for intelligent document processing and analysis.

**Multimodal AI:** Building systems that can understand and process multiple types of data (text, images, documents) simultaneously.

**AI in Finance:** Continuing to push the boundaries of AI applications in financial crime detection, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance.

**Cloud-Native AI:** Designing scalable AI solutions using cloud-native architectures, particularly on Google Cloud Platform.

**Educational Technology:** Developing AI-powered tools for question generation and educational content creation.
